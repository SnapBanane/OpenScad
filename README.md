## Introduction

The Sydney Opera House is one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, known for its unique and complex architecture. This project aims to recreate the Sydney Opera House as accurately as possible using OpenSCAD, a script-only based 3D CAD modeler.

## Features

- Accurate 3D model of the Sydney Opera House
- Detailed structure including sails and base
- Script-based modeling with OpenSCAD
- Suitable for educational purposes and architectural studies

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have OpenSCAD installed on your computer. You can download OpenSCAD from the official website: [OpenSCAD Download](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SnapBanane/sydney-opera-house-openscad.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sydney-opera-house-openscad
    ```

3. Open the `sydney_opera_house.scad` file in OpenSCAD:

    ```bash
    openscad sydney_opera_house.scad
    ```

## Usage

Once you have the project open in OpenSCAD, you can render the model by pressing `F5` for a preview or `F6` for a full render. You can also customize the model by editing the parameters in the `sydney_opera_house.scad` file.
